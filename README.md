# Swole - An app for experienced lifters to log their workouts and track their progress.
Swole will help experienced lifters track their training progress. Ditch spreadsheets and notebooks for Swole. 

Users will be able to start a new training session. They can add exercises to their session and set details including set number, load lifted, and reps performed. Users can also add notes on movements in their sessions. "Squats felt like garbage today. Need to have a snack before squatting next time." They can add additional tags to their note like- "PR", "Feeling swole!", "Going through the motions". 

Users can view their Training Log to see summaries of all their completed workouts. They can also search through Swole's exercise library filtering through the list of exerises by name, category and/or body part.

Finally users, can go to their profile to see their average rating of their training sessions.
